Current workflow if done on a sheet
- Connect to osu! API using the API key
- Allow sheet to authorize scripts
- Setup up mappools for each round
- If needed, enter mod settings/definitions and suggestors
- Sheet is updated and ready for entering suggestions
- Once a suggestion is entered through a map id/url, information will autofill into the sheet
- The suggestor will enter their name, the mod it should be used for, and any comments they have about it
- Once suggested, the other poolers can see and come to a consensus whether to pool the map or not
- Looking at the votes, if the map is agreed upon to be a good pick for a slot, it can be chosen for a specific slot
